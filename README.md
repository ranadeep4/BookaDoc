I'm excited to share my latest project—a MERN stack web application (𝗕𝗼𝗼𝗸𝗮𝗗𝗼𝗰) for booking doctor appointments! This project showcases the power of modern web development, and I’m thrilled to present its features:

🔷 𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘀
• Create an account and browse a variety of doctors (General Physician, Neurologist, Gynecologist, and more).
• Book appointments seamlessly and pay fees online using Razorpay integration.
• Cancel appointments if needed and update your profile anytime.
 
🔷 𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀
• Login to manage your appointments and check your earnings.
• Update your profile to keep information up-to-date.
 
🔷 𝗙𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗱𝗺𝗶𝗻
• A single admin with fixed credentials to manage the platform.
• Add new doctors to the system.
• View all appointments, track total doctors, users, and overall platform performance.
 
✨ This project combines modern technologies to create a user-friendly experience for patients, doctors, and admins alike.
